**Titanic Survival Prediction with DVC**



Project Objective



* Download Titanic dataset.
* Build a simple ML model (e.g., logistic regression).
* Use DVC to version the dataset and the trained model.
* Track metrics across experiments (like accuracy, F1 score). (Idea: simulate "data drift" by slightly modifying the data and retraining.)
